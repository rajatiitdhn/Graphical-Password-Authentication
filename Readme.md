# Graphical Password Authentication System

Project Overview :
This project aims to develop a secure and user-friendly graphical password authentication system to enhance traditional text-based password security. Users will enroll by uploading and arranging a sequence of 9 pictures, which will serve as their graphical password for subsequent logins.

Features : 
:- Graphical Password Enrollment : Users will select and arrange 9 pictures as their 
password, enhancing memorability and reducing vulnerability to brute-force 
attacks.
:- Random Image Presentation : During login, the pictures will be presented in a 
randomized order to prevent shoulder-surfing attacks.
:- Secure Hashing: Strong hashing algorithms will be used to store password data 
securely, protecting against unauthorized access.
:- Real-Time Authentication : Verification of users during login by replicating the 
same picture sequence.
:- Security measures : Account locking after a defined number of failed login 
attempts, in our case it is 4 attempts.

Technology stack :
 Visual Studio code : code editor for writing all the codes
 HTML : for the frontend structuring
 CSS : for the frontend designing
 JavaScript : for making the project responsive
 Firebase : firebase database for storing data
